# Audio Classification

A compact, easy-to-follow README for an audio classification project. This repository contains code and helpers to train, evaluate and run inference with audio classification models (e.g., environmental sound / speech command classification). The README below is intentionally written to be general — if you want, I can adapt it to the exact scripts, dataset paths and commands present in your repository.

## Project overview
This project provides a pipeline to build audio classification models from raw audio to predictions. It covers:
- dataset preparation and augmentation,
- feature extraction (e.g., log-mel spectrograms),
- model training (CNNs, pretrained backbones),
- evaluation and inference scripts,
- utilities for reproducibility and basic experiment tracking.

The README below describes common workflows and commands. If you prefer, I can update the commands to match the exact names and locations of scripts in this repo.

## Features
- Support for training and evaluating audio classification models.
- Standard preprocessing: resampling, trimming/padding, normalization.
- Feature extraction: STFT / Mel spectrograms / log-mel.
- Data augmentation: time shifting, noise injection, SpecAugment (if implemented).
- Config-driven experiments (YAML/JSON/args).
- Example inference snippet to classify single audio files or batches.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ (3.9 or 3.10 recommended)
- pip
- (optional) CUDA 11.x and a compatible GPU for faster training

Common Python packages (example):
- numpy
- librosa
- soundfile
- torch (PyTorch) or tensorflow depending on implementation
- torchaudio (if using PyTorch)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn (for plotting)

Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If a `requirements.txt` is not present, let me know and I can generate one from the repository files.

## Quick start
1. Prepare your environment and install dependencies (see above).
2. Prepare the dataset and directory layout (see Data section).
3. Train a model:
   - Example: `python scripts/train.py --config configs/train.yaml`
4. Evaluate a trained model:
   - Example: `python scripts/evaluate.py --checkpoint outputs/checkpoint_best.pth`
5. Run inference:
   - Example: `python scripts/infer.py --model outputs/checkpoint_best.pth --input audio.wav`

Note: replace script names and flags with those actually used in this repository — I can adapt this README to the repo's exact interfaces.

## Data
This project expects audio files organized with labels. Two common layouts:

1) Directory-per-class:
```
data/
  train/
    dog/
      dog_bark_001.wav
    siren/
      siren_001.wav
  val/
    ...
```

2) CSV manifest:
- A CSV with columns: `filepath,label` or `filepath,split,label`
- Example: `data/annotations.csv`

Data preparation steps:
- Resample audio to a target sample rate (e.g., 16 kHz or 44.1 kHz).
- Trim or pad audio to a fixed duration (e.g., 1s, 2s, 5s).
- Extract log-mel spectrograms or other features for model input.

If you use a public dataset (ESC-50, UrbanSound8K, FSDD, Speech Commands), include download and extraction instructions here. I can add specific instructions if you tell me which dataset you're using.

## Training
Typical training command (adjust to repo scripts):
```bash
python scripts/train.py \
  --data-dir data/train \
  --val-dir data/val \
  --batch-size 32 \
  --epochs 50 \
  --learning-rate 1e-3 \
  --sample-rate 16000 \
  --num-mels 64 \
  --output-dir outputs/exp01
```

Tips:
- Use mixed precision (AMP) for faster training on modern GPUs.
- Use a learning rate scheduler (ReduceLROnPlateau, CosineAnnealing, etc.).
- Seed RNGs for reproducibility.
- Log metrics (accuracy, f1-score, loss) and optionally use TensorBoard or WandB.

## Evaluation
Evaluate using held-out validation/test data:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/exp01/checkpoint_best.pth \
  --data-dir data/test \
  --batch-size 64
```

Common metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall / F1-score (macro / weighted)
- Confusion matrix
- ROC / PR curves (for multi-label or binary tasks)

## Inference / Usage
Single-file inference example:
```bash
python scripts/infer.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/exp01/checkpoint_best.pth \
  --input examples/dog_bark.wav
```

Programmatic inference in Python:
```python
from model import load_model, predict
model = load_model("outputs/exp01/checkpoint_best.pth")
preds = predict(model, "examples/dog_bark.wav")
print(preds)  # e.g., [{'label': 'dog', 'score': 0.92}, ...]
```

## Model architectures
Common choices:
- Small CNN from scratch (for fast prototyping)
- CRNN (CNN + RNN) for temporal modeling
- Pretrained audio backbones (VGGish, PANNs, YAMNet) with fine-tuning
- Transfer learning from image CNNs on spectrograms (ResNet, EfficientNet)

Document which architectures are implemented in the repo and provide config examples. If you want, I can scan your code and fill this section with accurate details.

## Experiments & results
Keep a log of hyperparameters and performance for reproducibility. A baseline to compare:
- Baseline model: small CNN, 1s audio, 16 kHz, 64 mel bins
- Baseline accuracy: X% (replace with your results)

Add tables and plots here once you have experiment outcomes.
